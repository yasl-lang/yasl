/*
 * Taken from: https://leetcode.com/problems/uncommon-words-from-two-sentences/
 *
 * We are given two sentences A and B.  (A sentence is a string of space separated words.  Each word consists only of lowercase letters.)
 *
 * A word is uncommon if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and does not appear in the other sentence.
 *
 * Return a list of all uncommon words.
 *
 * You may return the list in any order.
